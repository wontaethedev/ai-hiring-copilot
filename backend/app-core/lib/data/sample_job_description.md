# **Senior Product Engineer**

## **Company Overview**

elvex makes generative AI accessible, useful and secure for large businesses. We’re building a platform to empower anyone to build their own bespoke AI apps. Our approach leverages custom data, multiple models, and AI abstraction to let teams create dynamic apps in minutes. In the future elvex will power >50% of all AI apps inside a company.

We are a small, fully-remote, well-funded, and experienced team. We previously built, launched, scaled and exited Parse.ly, a digital analytics platform, that processed >1B events/day for 100s of customers. We sold Parse.ly to Automattic (the maintainers of WordPress) which was their largest acquisition in terms of both revenue and cost.

## **Job Description**

elvex is seeking a Senior Product Engineer to join our small but mighty engineering team.

### **Our Stack**

- Python: FastAPI, Celery, SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- TypeScript: React and Next
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Terraform (Infrastructure-as-code)
- Docker (both for local development as well as production deployment)

### **Qualifications**

- 5+ years experience building web apps with a preference for either frontend or backend development.
- Deep experience building production applications with one or more of: Django/Flask/FastAPI and React/Vue/Svelte.
- Experience in data modeling (bonus: you’ve had experience with both relational and non-relational databases).
- Experience in seeing a product or major feature from inception to production delivery.
- Experience provisioning infrastructure to support features (you’re not expected to be a DevOps engineer, but we do expect some base knowledge around provisioning).
- Extremely strong written communication skills (critical for a remote team).
- Solid understanding of modern software development lifecycle processes (we use continuous integration and delivery to release multiple times a week).

### **What you’ll help us do**

- Solve customer problems end-to-end. You’ll be given entire feature areas to implement from start to finish as well as smaller enhancements. Requests are often ambiguous and you’ll have to explore solutions before implementation. But, you won’t do this alone! You’ll have customers and a very supportive team as a sounding board for ideas and directions.
- Fix bugs and support our customers.
- Scale as we grow. We’ll proudly admit to doing some “things that didn’t scale” in our early releases to derisk something or try to immediately help a customer. As we scale, we’ll need smart and practical solutions that solve for our forecasted needs. Scaling applies equally well to technical solutions as well as process. We seek the minimal amount of process for a given stage of growth.

## **Why elvex?**

- Salary, Benefits and Equity: Starting at $150k USD with benefits, competitive stock options packages given our early phase (salary and equity are negotiable based on what you’re looking for in life).
- True remote culture: Our company is 100% remote and we’re a founding team that embraced remote work for 10 years pre-pandemic. We don’t even have an office to be nudging you back into a year from now.
- Maximal impact: You’ll be an early engineering hire. This means influencing what we build, how we build it as well as our company culture.
- Serious autonomy: Current engineers at elvex are given responsibility to implement entire features from start-to-finish. There will be no Product Manager providing you a list of scoped tickets, but instead a group of colleagues and customers you can use to shape ideas.
- Bring your own device: Use the tools that make you the most productive and use our equipment budget to upgrade where needed.
- Equipment budget: $2k USD upon starting for you to use as you wish. Buy a new computer, a standing desk, a monitor, a treadmill, etc.
- Vacation: Unlimited (we just ask that you provide us more heads up the longer the time off you plan to take).
- Personal and professional growth: In our previous company, most employees worked together for 5+ years. That’s an unheard of tenure in tech, but its because all of us care deeply about pushing each other to do our best and giving space to learn. That may mean using an experimental technology, giving a conference talk, or exploring management. Whatever your goals, we want elvex to be a career-defining place for you.
- Work-life Balance: The elvex founding team all have families. We all work hard, but we understand not just the need for down time, but its benefits.
